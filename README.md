    C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This project covers the concepts of binary trees! This was a project done with the contribution of my peer in many other SWE projects Jorge Zafra Kudos!

At the end of this project, We were able to understand these questions:

    What is a binary tree?
    What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
    What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
    What are the depth, height, the size of a binary tree
    What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
    What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
